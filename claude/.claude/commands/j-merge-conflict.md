## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current branch: !`git branch --show-current`

## Your task

Help me resolve merge conflicts.

Rules:

- Keep additions from both sides when possible
- For version numbers, take the higher version
- For lists/arrays, combine items
- Resolve semantic conflicts intelligently
