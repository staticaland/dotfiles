Use `stow` to symlink the folders to the parent directory. The parent directory should be `$HOME`.

# Shell setup

I like `fish`.

```
sudo dnf install fish
```

Install [fisherman](https://github.com/fisherman/fisherman).

Run `fisherman fzf` to install a nice reverse incremental history search based on `fzf`.

```
xcompmgr -cfC
```
