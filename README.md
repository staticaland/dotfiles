I use `stow` to symlink the config. The parent directory should be `$HOME`.

For example:

```
stow ./nvim
```

This means to take everything inside the nvim folder and symlink it to the parent directory (`..`). The parent directory happens to be stows default location for the -t option.

# IRL dotfiles

I stopped typing on a device modeled after 19th century typewriters.

I get annoyed when I have to write {}[] on a NO layout. How does this affect my productivity? How many people feel the same way, and how does it affect the world?

Many CLI tools like `vim` are biased towards the US layout.

I use the [Keyboardio Model 01](https://keyboard.io) with a US inspired layout to get around this.

Since coding is the most ergonomically and mentally taxing activity, I choose to optimize for it.

My far fetched hypothesis is that these factors hold developers back in countries that don't use a US layout.
