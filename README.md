<p>What?</p>

</div>

I use `stow` to symlink the config. The parent directory should be `$HOME`.

For example:

```
stow ./nvim
```

This means to take everything inside the nvim folder and symlink it to the parent directory (`..`). The parent directory happens to be stows default location for the `-t` option.

When I have to write `{}[]:` on a NO layout I feel like something is holding me back. So how does this affect my productivity? How many people feel the same way, and how does it affect the *world*?

Programming syntax and CLI tools (like `vim`) are biased towards the US layout. It doesn't make sense to use a NO layout. It took me a long time to figure this out.

I forced myself to switch by using the [Keyboardio Model 01](https://keyboard.io). It also taught me how to touch type. Once you get used to this keyboard, only insanity could convince you to go back.
